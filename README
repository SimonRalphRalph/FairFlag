# ðŸš© FairFlag â€“ Payroll Safeguarding Prototype

FairFlag is a lightweight, rule-based demo application designed to detect patterns of potential labor exploitation in payroll data â€” such as modern slavery indicators â€” using configurable compliance rules. Itâ€™s built as a proof of concept for ethical payroll analysis, enabling employers and compliance teams to spot red flags before they become reputational or legal risks.

Why FairFlag?

Thousands of workers across industries like agriculture, logistics, hospitality, and food processing are vulnerable to modern slavery â€” often hidden in plain sight within legitimate payroll systems.

FairFlag scans for early warning signs including:
- Duplicate bank accounts across multiple employees
- Shared residential addresses
- Below minimum wage payments
- Excessive weekly working hours

These signals may indicate exploitative or coerced labor conditions â€” and are often missed by conventional payroll audits.
